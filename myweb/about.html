                <h2>What is intangible cultural heritage</h2>
                <p>An intangible cultural heritage (ICH) is a practice, representation, expression, knowledge, or skill
                    considered by
                    UNESCO to be part of a place's cultural heritage. Buildings, historic places, monuments, and
                    artifacts
                    are cultural
                    property. Intangible heritage consists of nonphysical intellectual wealth, such as folklore,
                    customs,
                    beliefs,
                    traditions, knowledge, and language. Intangible cultural heritage is considered by member states of
                    UNESCO in relation
                    to the tangible World Heritage focusing on intangible aspects of culture.
                </p>
                <p>2001, UNESCO made a
                    survey among States
                    and NGOs to try to agree on a definition, and the Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible
                    Cultural Heritage
                    was drafted in 2003 for its protection and promotion.

                <h2>Nowadays</h2>
                <h2>My passion to make the website</h2>
                <p>
                    As a Chinese international student from a country with a history spanning five millennia, I have
                    always been
                    captivated
                    by the rich tapestry of our country's cultural heritage. It is a legacy that has endured the test of
                    time, passed
                    down
                    through centuries of change. Motivated by my love for our cultural treasures and a sense of urgency
                    spurred by their
                    gradual disappearance, I created a platform dedicated to promoting China's intangible cultural
                    heritage.

                    Immersing myself in folk literature, music and dance, traditional drama and storytelling, acrobatics
                    and sports,
                    fine
                    arts, and traditional medicine, I've curated a comprehensive showcase of these cultural elements on
                    Chinese
                    Intangible
                    Cultural Heritage Website. Whether it's delving into ancient folklore, experiencing the charm of
                    traditional music,
                    or
                    witnessing the magic of Chinese theater, my aim is to educate, engage, and ignite a love for
                    intangible cultural
                    heritage.

                    I work hard to promote China's excellent intangible cultural heritage on my website, hoping to
                    attract more people's
                    attention to this excellent culture and attract more people to understand, appreciate and inherit
                    it. I believe that
                    through collective efforts we can ensure that these valuable cultural traditions are protected and
                    continue to grow.

                    Join us in exploring the richness of China's intangible cultural heritage and in carrying forward
                    our cultural
                    legacy!
                    <!-- As a Chinese international student, I am deeply passionate about preserving and promoting China's
