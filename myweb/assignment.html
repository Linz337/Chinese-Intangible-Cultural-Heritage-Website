  <h1><b> My assignment.html page for linking to assignment items for your Website Assesment</b></h1>
  <p><br></p>
  <p>This page is the marking guide to your website that your tutor will use to find your elements. Do not name this
    page anything other than assignment.html (all lower case) or else we may not be able to find and mark your
    assignment elements.<span>&nbsp; </span>How to use this page:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Please, link this page to your website's index.html page</li>
    <li>over time, link each assignment task listed below to its location in your website as soon as you have started it
    </li>
    <li>replace the "notes" paragraph with your notes or
      delete if you have no notes - your notes will help us understand and
      mark your site so you should explain things. Maybe you did a task
      differently from the way we specified it, either because your way is
      better (tell us) or minimally or not at all to fit in with your site's
      look and feel (tell us) or ... (also tell us). So, for example, a video
      might spoil the look and feel. What you do is make one anyway, link to
      it from this assessment.html page and explain in the <i>Notes</i> why
      it's not linked to from your public version of your web site. You can
      style this page as your like, so long as you keep the links to the
      assignment tasks.</li>
    <li>provide link to report where indicated</li>
    <li>delete these instructions when you are ready</li>
  </ul>

  <p><a href="about.html">Chinese Intangible Cultural Heritage Website</a></p>
  <p>As a Chinese international student from a country with a history spanning five millennia, I have always been
    captivated
    by the rich tapestry of our country's cultural heritage. It is a legacy that has endured the test of time, passed
    down
    through centuries of change. Motivated by my love for our cultural treasures and a sense of urgency spurred by their
    gradual disappearance, I created a platform dedicated to promoting China's intangible cultural heritage.

    Immersing myself in folk literature, music and dance, traditional drama and storytelling, acrobatics and sports,
    fine
    arts, and traditional medicine, I've curated a comprehensive showcase of these cultural elements on Chinese
    Intangible
    Cultural Heritage Website. Whether it's delving into ancient folklore, experiencing the charm of traditional music,
    or
    witnessing the magic of Chinese theater, my aim is to educate, engage, and ignite a love for intangible cultural
    heritage.

    I work hard to promote China's excellent intangible cultural heritage on my website, hoping to attract more people's
    attention to this excellent culture and attract more people to understand, appreciate and inherit it. I believe that
    through collective efforts we can ensure that these valuable cultural traditions are protected and continue to grow.

    Join us in exploring the richness of China's intangible cultural heritage and in carrying forward our cultural
    legacy!

  <h2><b>Continuous Improvement Session</b></h2>
  <p>The spread of misleading information on social media and the internet has been a prominent effect of digital
    media's ongoing rapid evolution throughout time. Building trust and reliability in the digital sphere has become
    extremely
    difficult as a result of the spread of false information. But the JPEG Trust framework's introduction has shown to
    be a thorough way to deal with these problems.

    JPEG Trust offers a strong framework that is ideal for enabling individuals, companies, and governing entities in
    creating a trustworthy environment for the media they use and exchange online.

    This framework, as described in the white paper, addresses a variety of media elements, including identification of
    resources and stakeholders, origin, genuineness, consistency, and intellectual property rights. This
    all-encompassing approach ensures that confidence is built on all fronts related to digital media, which in turn
    increases its effectiveness and adoption.

    In my opinion, the practicality and potential widespread adoption of the JPEG Trust framework make it an invaluable
    tool in harnessing the benefits of modern digital media while effectively combating misinformation.

    In addition, I would like to know how the JPEG Trust framework addresses concerns regarding privacy and security.
    What specific measures are taken, and how does it prevent the leakage of protected information?
